Hi all! Here is the working list of SMART questions based on professor feedback

1.    How many accidents, accidents involving injury, and fatal accidents were the each year in NYC in recent years?
2.    Do any NYC zip codes have a statistically significantly higher rate of indury or death in traffic accidents than the average rate?
3.    Are accidents involving alcohol more deadly than others?
4.    Did accidents become less frequent or less deadly after/during the pandemic?
5.    Were accidents more or less likely to result in cyclist injury or death pre v. post-pandemic?
6.    Has the frequency of accidents or deadliness of accidents returned to pre-COVID levels?
7.    Can we predict incidence of injury or death using the variables in the data set (either pre- or post-covid)?
